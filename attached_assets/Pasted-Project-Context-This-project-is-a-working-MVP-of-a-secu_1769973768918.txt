Project Context

This project is a working MVP of a secure document access system inspired by DigiLocker, built for logistics / transport / import–export use cases.

The system is already functional and runs locally. It has:

An Admin Panel for uploading documents (PDFs & images)

A Public Dashboard accessed via QR code + authentication key

Documents are rendered directly on the public page

Admin can generate authentication keys and QR codes

Access is controlled and secured at the application level

This is a temporary but production-style system built under urgent timelines for a real client demo. The core logic already works correctly.

Your Task

Do NOT rewrite the entire backend logic unless required.
Focus on professional UI/UX improvements, usability, and feature polish, while keeping the existing functionality intact.

Improve the project to feel like a real commercial SaaS product dashboard.

🎨 UI / UX Improvements Required
Admin Panel

Redesign the admin panel with a modern, clean, professional layout

Use:

Card-based layout

Rounded buttons

Proper spacing and typography

Replace default file input with a custom “Upload Document” button

After upload:

Document should appear instantly in a documents list/table

No “confirm upload” button (upload = auto-confirm)

Documents List (Admin)

Show documents in a structured table with:

File name

File type (PDF/Image)

Upload timestamp

Each document row must have:

Edit / Replace button (replace document via file picker)

Delete button (with confirmation)

Actions should update UI instantly (no refresh)

QR Code Section

Add a dedicated QR Code section in the admin dashboard

When “Generate QR Code” is clicked:

QR code should appear inside the same page

No page redirects

QR code design should be centered and visually clean

Authentication Key Display

When a new authentication key is generated:

Show it clearly in the admin dashboard

Allow copying the key easily

Make the key visually distinct (badge / highlight)

Admin Login Page

Improve login page design (not plain HTML)

If password is wrong:

Show inline error message

Do NOT redirect to a blank page

Allow retry on the same screen

🌐 Public Dashboard Improvements

Clean, minimal, professional UI

Documents should:

Render directly on the page

Be large enough to read without zooming

Not take full screen, but be clearly visible

Support multiple documents smoothly

Maintain good spacing and alignment

⚙️ Functional Improvements

Ensure:

Multiple document uploads are supported

Uploading a new document does NOT delete old ones

Admin document list always reflects actual uploaded files

Make UI reactive (DOM updates instead of reloads)

Add basic error handling and user feedback where needed

🛠️ Technical Constraints

Keep the existing project structure

Use:

Vanilla JS / existing frontend stack

No heavy framework migration unless absolutely necessary

Code must remain:

Easy to run locally

Easy to demo

Easy to extend later

🎯 End Goal

Transform this working MVP into a:

Client-ready demo

Professional-looking admin dashboard

Secure, clean public access system

Product that feels like an early-stage startup SaaS

Proceed step-by-step and update files cleanly.
